## Description
Implement the core functionality to generate a PlantUML class diagram showing all classes and their relationships within a .NET solution. The diagram should include class definitions, inheritance relationships, and associations between classes within the solution's projects.

## Objectives
1. Parse all C# files in the solution to extract class information
2. Identify relationships between classes (inheritance, composition, aggregation)
3. Generate a complete PlantUML class diagram
4. Support basic class members (properties and methods)
5. Provide reliable command-line interface

## Steps
1. Enhance ClassAnalyzer to:
   - Extract class definitions and modifiers (abstract, sealed, etc.)
   - Identify base classes and implemented interfaces
   - Capture property and method signatures with visibility (public, private, protected, internal)
   - Detect relationships between classes
   - Handle generic type parameters and constraints
   - Process nested classes

2. Extend PlantUmlGenerator to:
   - Generate class definitions in PlantUML syntax
   - Represent inheritance relationships (extends, implements)
   - Show class members with proper visibility (+, -, #, ~)
   - Create relationship arrows (--|>, -->, --o, --*)
   - Format generic types (<T>, <T: constraint>)
   - Group classes by namespace
   - Apply consistent styling (rectangles, colors, fonts)

3. Implement solution traversal:
   - Process all C# files in the solution
   - Handle multiple projects
   - Maintain proper namespacing
   - Skip generated files
   - Handle partial classes

4. Implement command-line interface:
   - Parse command-line arguments
   - Validate input paths
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Return appropriate exit codes

5. Add comprehensive tests:
   - Unit tests:
     * Class analysis components
     * PlantUML generation
     * Command-line argument parsing
     * Error handling

   - Integration tests:
     * Full solution analysis
     * Multi-project handling
     * Namespace organization

   - End-to-end tests:
     * Command-line execution tests:
       - Valid solution path
       - Invalid solution path
       - Invalid output path
       - Missing permissions
       - Various error conditions
     * Output validation tests:
       - Verify .puml file generation
       - Validate PlantUML syntax
       - Test rendering with plantuml.jar
       - Verify all classes are included
       - Check relationship accuracy
     * Sample project tests:
       - Simple class hierarchy
       - Complex inheritance
       - Generic classes
       - Nested classes
       - Different visibility modifiers
       - Various relationship types

## Progress
- [ ] Class information extraction
- [ ] Relationship detection
- [ ] PlantUML generation
- [ ] Solution traversal
- [ ] Command-line interface
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] End-to-end tests
- [ ] Documentation

## Dependencies
None

## Notes
- Focus only on classes within the solution (no external dependencies)
- Include proper visibility modifiers (public, private, protected, internal)
- Handle generic types appropriately
- Consider namespace organization in the diagram layout

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Command Line Usage
   - [ ] Can be run from command line with syntax: `cs2plant <solution-path> <output-path>`
   - [ ] Generates a .puml file at the specified output path
   - [ ] Returns appropriate exit codes (0 for success, non-zero for errors)
   - [ ] Provides clear error messages for common issues (file not found, invalid solution, etc.)

2. Output Generation
   - [ ] Generated .puml file can be successfully rendered by plantuml.jar
   - [ ] All classes from the solution are included in the diagram
   - [ ] Diagram is generated without errors or warnings from PlantUML
   - [ ] Output is deterministic (same input produces same output)

3. Class Analysis
   - [ ] All classes in the solution are correctly identified
   - [ ] Class modifiers (abstract, sealed, static) are captured
   - [ ] Generic type parameters and constraints are preserved
   - [ ] Nested and partial classes are properly handled
   - [ ] All visibility modifiers are correctly identified

4. Relationships
   - [ ] Inheritance relationships are correctly shown
   - [ ] Interface implementations are properly represented
   - [ ] Composition/aggregation relationships are detected
   - [ ] Relationship arrows use correct PlantUML syntax

5. Members
   - [ ] Properties show correct visibility and type
   - [ ] Methods show visibility, parameters, and return type
   - [ ] Generic methods are properly formatted
   - [ ] Property accessors (get, set, init) are shown

6. Output Quality
   - [ ] PlantUML syntax is valid and renders correctly
   - [ ] Namespaces are properly organized
   - [ ] Diagram is clear and readable
   - [ ] Styling is consistent throughout

## Next Steps
1. Review existing ClassAnalyzer implementation
2. Design the class relationship detection algorithm
3. Plan the PlantUML output format
4. Create test cases with various class relationships
