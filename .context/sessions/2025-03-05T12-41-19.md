## Focus
Initial project planning and task definition for cs2plant, focusing on core class diagram generation functionality.

## Context
- Created initial project planning document
- Defined core functionality requirements
- Created detailed tasks for namespace cleanup and basic class diagram generation
- Refined acceptance criteria and testing requirements

## Progress
1. Created `.context/plan/planning_document.md` with:
   - Project overview and goals
   - Current state analysis
   - Implementation plan
   - Success criteria
   - Timeline

2. Created `.context/tasks/planned/TASK-000.md` with:
   - Namespace and reference cleanup requirements
   - Build and test verification steps
   - Documentation update requirements

3. Created `.context/tasks/planned/TASK-001.md` with:
   - Detailed implementation steps
   - Comprehensive acceptance criteria
   - End-to-end testing requirements
   - Command-line interface specifications

4. Refined TASK-001 to include:
   - Clear command-line usage requirements
   - Explicit output validation criteria
   - Comprehensive end-to-end testing plan
   - PlantUML rendering verification

## Decisions
1. Focus on core class diagram generation as primary feature
2. Add preliminary namespace cleanup task (TASK-000)
3. Exclude external dependencies from diagrams
4. Include comprehensive class relationship detection
5. Prioritize proper handling of C# language features (generics, visibility, etc.)
6. Ensure end-to-end testing with actual PlantUML rendering

## Self-Improvement
1. Process Insights:
   - Started with clear scope definition
   - Broke down requirements into actionable tasks
   - Added detailed acceptance criteria
   - Identified prerequisite work (namespace cleanup)

2. Efficiency Insights:
   - Focused on essential functionality first
   - Created clear, testable requirements
   - Structured documentation for maintainability
   - Emphasized end-to-end validation

## Dependencies
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- MSBuild tools
- Java Runtime (for PlantUML)

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of TASK-000 (namespace cleanup)
2. Review existing ClassAnalyzer implementation
3. Design class relationship detection algorithm
4. Plan PlantUML output format
5. Create test cases

## Notes
- Existing codebase has basic class analysis functionality
- Need to enhance relationship detection
- Consider adding configuration options in future iterations
- End-to-end testing with PlantUML rendering is critical for validation
