# Focus
Namespace and project reference cleanup (TASK-000)

# Context
- Initial project setup phase
- Converting from old name to cs2plant naming

# Progress
âœ… Completed TASK-000: Update Project Namespaces and References
- Updated all namespace declarations from old name to cs2plant
- Updated all using statements to reference new namespaces
- Updated project references in documentation
- Updated Console project usage text
- Verified no old namespace references remain
- Moved task to completed folder

# Decisions
1. Considered but rejected simplifying PlantUML tests
   - Initially thought to remove PlantUML jar execution
   - Realized this would weaken test quality
   - Kept PlantUML execution as it's critical for validation
   - Added string assertions as additional validation

# Self-Improvement
## Process Insights
- Successfully followed the namespace update pattern:
  1. Update project files first
  2. Update source files
  3. Update test files
  4. Update documentation
  5. Verify with grep search
- Recognized importance of maintaining proper test coverage and validation

## Efficiency Insights
- Used grep search effectively to find remaining references
- Maintained comprehensive test coverage while updating namespaces
- Properly evaluated impact of test changes before committing

## Pattern Insights
- Identified common patterns in namespace updates
- Standardized on file-scoped namespaces
- Consistent use of cs2plant prefix
- Maintained strong test validation patterns

# Dependencies
No new dependencies introduced

# Next Steps
1. Review and test the updated codebase
2. Consider adding automated namespace validation
3. Update any CI/CD pipelines if present
4. Document Java requirement for running tests

# Notes
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes introduced
- Test suite remains green after updates
- PlantUML validation remains robust
